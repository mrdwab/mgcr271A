    <p>This is the definition of a confidence interval. Note that the true mean is a fixed number and hence the probability it is contained in an interval is either zero or one. It is the confidence interval that is random and hence we can only conclude that we have 95% confidence that the interval we constructed is one which contains the true mean.</p>

You suspect that incoming freshmen have a mean μ, which is different from 115, because they are often excited and anxious about entering college.  To test your suspicion, you test the hypotheses H0: μ = 115, Ha: μ ≠ 115. You give the SSHA to 25 students who are incoming freshmen and find their mean score is 116.2.

<h2>Question 19</h2>

<p>A researcher wishes to determine if listening to classical music improves the concentration of office workers.  To investigate this, he decides to see if office workers are able to complete a certain pencil-and-paper maze more quickly while listening to classical music.  Suppose the time (in seconds) needed for office workers to complete the maze while listening to classical music follows a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ = 4.  Suppose also, that in the general population, the time needed to complete the maze (without listening to classical music) follows a normal distribution with mean 40 and standard deviation σ = 4.  The researcher, therefore, decides to test the hypotheses H0: μ = 40, Ha: μ &lt; 40. To do so, the researcher has 10,000 office workers complete the maze with classical music playing.  The mean time for these workers is   = 39.8 seconds and the P-value is less than 0.0001. Suppose that two office workers decide to see if they get the same results as the researcher.  They both take the maze while listening to classical music.  The mean of their times is   = 39.8 seconds, the same as that of the researcher.  It is appropriate to conclude which of the following? </p>

<ol>
<li>They have reproduced the results of the researcher and their P-value will be the same as that of the researcher. </li>
<li>They have reproduced the results of the researcher, but their P-value will be slightly smaller than that of the researcher. </li>

A 95% confidence interval for \(\mu\) would consist of values lying within 1.6449 standard errors from \(\bar{x}\). Since 1 lies 2.0141 standard errors from \(\bar{x}\), it won&#39;t lie in the 95% confidence interval. However, a 99% confidence interval for \(\mu\) would consist of values lying within 2.5758 standard errors from \(\bar{x}\) and since 1 lies 2.0141 standard errors from \(\bar{x}\), it will lie in the 99% confidence interval. The question of whether ZERO would lie within the 95%/99% intervals will depend on the actual values of \(n\). </p>
