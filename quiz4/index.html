    <p>This is the definition of a confidence interval. Note that the true mean is a fixed number and hence the probability it is contained in an interval is either zero or one. It is the confidence interval that is random and hence we can only conclude that we have 95% confidence that the interval we constructed is one which contains the true mean.</p>

You suspect that incoming freshmen have a mean μ, which is different from 115, because they are often excited and anxious about entering college.  To test your suspicion, you test the hypotheses H0: μ = 115, Ha: μ ≠ 115. You give the SSHA to 25 students who are incoming freshmen and find their mean score is 116.2.

  <p>The level of calcium in the blood of healthy young adults follows a normal distribution with mean μ = 10 milligrams per deciliter and standard deviation σ = 0.4.  A clinic measures the blood calcium of 100 healthy pregnant young women at their first visit for prenatal care.  The mean of these 100 measurements is 9.8.  Is this evidence that the mean calcium level in the population from which these women come is less than 10?  To answer this, test the hypotheses H0: μ = 10, Ha: μ &lt; 10. The P-value of your test is: </p>

  <p>The nicotine content in cigarettes of a certain brand is normally distributed, with mean (in milligrams) μ and standard deviation σ = 0.1.  The brand advertises that the mean nicotine content of its cigarettes is 1.5, but measurements on a random sample of 100 cigarettes of this brand give a mean of 1.53.  Is this evidence that the mean nicotine content is actually higher than advertised?  To answer this, test the hypotheses H0: μ = 1.5, Ha: μ &gt; 1.5 at the 5% significance level.  You conclude: </p>

  <p>Does vigorous exercise affect concentration?  In general, the time needed for people to complete a certain paper-and-pencil maze follows a normal distribution, with a mean of 30 seconds and a standard deviation of three seconds.  You wish to see if the mean time μ is changed by vigorous exercise, so you have a random sample of nine employees of your company (that you assume are representative of people in general) exercise vigorously for 30 minutes and then complete the maze.  It takes them an average of 31.2 seconds to complete the maze.  Use this information to test the hypotheses H0: μ = 30, Ha: μ ≠ 30 at the 1% significance level.  You conclude: </p>

    <p>During the winter months, heating bills can be expensive.  A contractor claims that installing a new brand of insulation will considerably lower your heating bill (which was $205 last month).  After conducting the test (assuming the data were provided), you find that the results are significant at the 5% level.  You may also conclude: 
*A) the test would also be significant at the 10% level. 
B) the test would also be significant at the 1% level. 
C) all of these
D) none of these</p>

<p>An agricultural researcher plants 25 plots with a new variety of corn that is drought resistant and hence potentially more profitable.  The average yield for these plots is   = 150 bushels per acre.  Assume that the yield per acre for the new variety of corn follows a normal distribution with unknown mean μ and that a 95% confidence interval for μ is found to be 150 ± 3.29.  Which of the following is true? 
A) A test of the hypotheses H0: μ = 150, Ha: μ ≠ 150 would be rejected at the 0.05 level. 
B) A test of the hypotheses H0: μ = 150, Ha: μ &gt; 150 would be rejected at the 0.05 level. 
*C) A test of the hypotheses H0: μ = 160, Ha: μ ≠ 160 would be rejected at the 0.05 level. 
D) All the above. </p>
