A researcher is interested in the size of the current balance of credit card holders.  To estimate this, he obtains the size of the current balance of a random sample of 25 credit card holders.  A 90% confidence interval for the mean current balance of credit card holders is found to be $662.72 ± $44.70.  Which of the following would produce a confidence interval with a smaller margin of error than this 90% confidence interval? 
A) Obtain the balances of only five credit card holders rather than 25, because five are likely to be more uniform than 25. 
*B) Obtain the balances of 100 credit card holders rather than 25. 
C) Compute a 99% confidence interval rather than a 90% confidence interval.  The increase in confidence indicates that we have a better interval.

The Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes (SSHA) is a psychological test that measures the motivation, attitude, and study habits of college students.  Scores range from 0 to 200 and follow (approximately) a normal distribution with mean 115 and standard deviation σ = 25.  You suspect that incoming freshmen have a mean μ, which is different from 115, because they are often excited and anxious about entering college.  To test your suspicion, you test the hypotheses H0: μ = 115, Ha: μ ≠ 115.
You give the SSHA to 25 students who are incoming freshmen and find their mean score is 116.2.  The p-value of your test is: 
A) 0.1151.

*A) that H0 should be rejected. 
B) that H0 should not be rejected. 
C) that Ha should be rejected. 
D) there is a 5% chance that the null hypothesis is true.

Does vigorous exercise affect concentration?  In general, the time needed for people to complete a certain paper-and-pencil maze follows a normal distribution, with a mean of 30 seconds and a standard deviation of three seconds.  You wish to see if the mean time μ is changed by vigorous exercise, so you have a random sample of nine employees of your company (that you assume are representative of people in general) exercise vigorously for 30 minutes and then complete the maze.  It takes them an average of   = 31.2 seconds to complete the maze.  Use this information to test the hypotheses H0: μ = 30, Ha: μ ≠ 30 at the 1% significance level.  You conclude:

A financial advisor is working to create a new investment package for is clients.  The average return on current packages is 1.2%.  In an early experiment, she tries the new investment package with three clients and returns more than doubled to 3%.  Although the rate of return has doubled, the results are not statistically significant even at the 0.10 significance level.  The explanation is: 
A) the placebo effect is present which limits statistical significance. 
*B) the sample size is too small to determine if the observed increase cannot be reasonably attributed to chance. 
C) that although the rate of return has more than doubled, in reality the actual increase is really 1.2%. 
D) the calculation was in error.  The advisor forgot to include the sample size.

Ten years ago the mean Math SAT score of all high school students who took the exam in a small high school was 490, with a standard deviation of 80.  This year, a boxplot of the scores of a random sample of 25 students in the high school who took the exam is given on the next page. The mean score of these 25 students is   = 530.  We assume the population standard deviation continues to be σ = 80.  To determine if there is evidence that the scores in the district have improved, the hypotheses H0: μ = 490, Ha: μ > 490 are tested using the z statistic, and the P-value is found to be 0.0062.

A) at the 5% significance level, you have proved that H0 is false. 
B) at the 5% significance level, you have proved that Ha is false. 
C) it would have been more appropriate to use a two-sided alternative. 
*D) none of the above.

An engineer designs an improved light bulb.  The previous design had an average lifetime of 1200 hours.  The mean lifetime of a random sample of 2000 new bulbs is found to have a mean lifetime of 1201 hours.  Although the difference from the old mean lifetime of 1200 hours is quite small, the P-value is 0.03 and the effect is statistically significant at the 0.05 level.  If, in fact, there is no difference between the mean lifetimes of the new and old designs, the researcher has: 
*A) committed a type I error. 
B) committed a type II error. 
C) a probability of being correct, which is equal to the P-value. 
D) a probability of being correct, which is equal to 1 – (P-value).

A medical researcher is working on a new treatment for a certain type of cancer.  The average survival time after diagnosis on the standard treatment is two years.  In an early trial, she tries the new treatment on three subjects, who have an average survival time after diagnosis of four years.  Although the survival time has doubled, the results are not statistically significant even at the 0.10 significance level.  Suppose, in fact, that the new treatment does increase the mean survival time in the population of all patients with this particular type of cancer.  The researcher has: 
A) committed a type I error. 
*B) committed a type II error. 
C) incorrectly used a level 0.10 test when she should have used a 0.05 level test. 
D) incorrectly used a level 0.10 test when she should have computed the P-value.

A researcher wishes to determine if listening to classical music improves the concentration of office workers.  To investigate this, he decides to see if office workers are able to complete a certain pencil-and-paper maze more quickly while listening to classical music.  Suppose the time (in seconds) needed for office workers to complete the maze while listening to classical music follows a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ = 4.  Suppose also, that in the general population, the time needed to complete the maze (without listening to classical music) follows a normal distribution with mean 40 and standard deviation σ = 4.  The researcher, therefore, decides to test the hypotheses H0: μ = 40, Ha: μ < 40. To do so, the researcher has 10,000 office workers complete the maze with classical music playing.  The mean time for these workers is   = 39.8 seconds and the P-value is less than 0.0001. Suppose that two office workers decide to see if they get the same results as the researcher.  They both take the maze while listening to classical music.  The mean of their times is   = 39.8 seconds, the same as that of the researcher.  It is appropriate to conclude which of the following? 
A) They have reproduced the results of the researcher and their P-value will be the same as that of the researcher. 
B) They have reproduced the results of the researcher, but their P-value will be slightly smaller than that of the researcher. 
C) They will reach the same statistical conclusion as the researcher, but their P-value will be a bit different than that of the researcher. 
*D) None of these
