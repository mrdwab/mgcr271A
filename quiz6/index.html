<p>Has the number of home runs hit by major league teams been changing over time?  For the 41 years from 1960 to 2000, the average number of home runs hit per game per team for each season was computed in order to assess any change over time.  Initially, simple linear regression was used to study the trend in home runs hit over the period 1960 to 2000 by using year to predict the average number of home runs per game per team in that year.  However, it was pointed out that after the 1976 season the manufacturer of major league baseballs was changed from Spaulding to Rawlings.  Because the change in the baseball used might affect the number of home runs (for example, if Rawlings produces a livelier ball, this would likely lead to more home runs), it was decided to include an additional variable. A multiple regression analysis was performed using the model:</p>

<p>μAvg. home runs per game per team = β0 + β1(Year) + β2(Manufacturer)</p>

<p>where Manufacturer = 0 for Rawlings and 1 for Spaulding</p>

    <p>A company runs a three-day workshop on strategies for working effectively in teams.  On each day a different strategy is presented.  Forty-eight employees of the company attend the workshop.  At the outset, all 48 are divided into 12 teams of four.  The teams remain the same for the entire workshop.  Strategies are presented in the morning.  In the afternoon, the teams are presented with a series of small tasks, and the number completed successfully using the strategy taught that morning is recorded for each team.  The mean number of tasks completed successfully by all teams each day and the standard deviation are computed. The results are given on the next slide.</p>

    <p>Given \(\alpha = 5%\), the null hypothesis would be rejected if \(z > 1.6449\). This translates to rejecting \(H_0\) if we get a sample mean \(\bar{x} > 1.5 + 1.6449 \times 0.1/\sqrt{100}\),  or \(\bar{x} > 1.5164\). If the alternate were true, then \(\mu_a = 1.6\). So the null would be rejected when the z-score exceeds \(\frac{\bar{x}-\mu_{a}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\). Plugging in values, we get -8.3551. Power of the test is the area corresponding to the rejection region under the alternate hypothesis, which clearly will be close to 100%. See next slide for a visualization.</p>

    <h2>Question 4</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article>
    <p>A sports writer wished to see if a football filled with helium travels farther, on average, than a football filled with air.  To test this, the writer used 18 adult male volunteers.  These volunteers were randomly divided into two groups of nine subjects each.  Group 1 kicked a football filled with helium to the recommended pressure.  Group 2 kicked a football filled with air to the recommended pressure.  The mean yardage for group 1 was 30 yards with a standard deviation s1 = 8 yards.  The mean yardage for group 2 was 26 yards with a standard deviation s2 = 6 yards.  Assume the two groups of kicks are independent.  Let μ1 and μ2 represent the mean yardage we would observe for the entire population represented by the volunteers if all members of this population kicked, respectively, a helium- and an air-filled football.  Assume that two sample t procedures are safe to use.</p>
