Q: >
  In this example, we notice:
A:
 - there is clear evidence of bias in the results.  This is undoubtedly due to the lack of blinding on the part of the subjects.
 - the data show very strong evidence of a violation of the assumption that the three populations have the same standard deviation.
 - ANOVA cannot be used on these data because the sample sizes are less than 20.
 - =the assumption that the data are independent for the three days is unreasonable, because the same teams were observed each day.

Q: >
  For this example, which of the following conclusions is most reasonable?
A:
 - There is moderate evidence that the strategies taught are effective in increasing the number of tasks completed successfully for the first two days, but then the effect appears to wear off.
 - An ANOVA F test is not appropriate for these data.  Instead, the researchers should have done several tests to see if the number of tasks completed successfully differed for the three days.  This analysis would have shown the treatment was effective.
 - The data provide strong evidence that the mean number of tasks completed successfully differ for the three strategies taught.
 - =The data appear to provide little or no evidence that the strategies taught differ in their effectiveness in helping teams complete tasks successfully.

 The Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes (SSHA) is a psychological test that measures the motivation, attitude, and study habits of college students.  Scores range  from 0 to 200 and follow (approximately) a normal distribution with mean 115 and standard deviation σ = 25.  You suspect that incoming freshmen have a mean μ, which is different from 115, because they are often excited and anxious about entering college.  To test your suspicion, you test the hypotheses H0: μ = 115, Ha: μ ≠ 115. You give the SSHA to 25 students who are incoming freshmen and find their mean score is 116.2.  The P-value of your test is:

Q: > 
 An inspector inspects large truckloads of potatoes to determine the proportion p in the shipment with major defects prior to using the potatoes to make potato chips. 
 Unless there is clear evidence that this proportion is less than 0.10, she will reject the shipment.  To reach a decision, she will test the hypotheses H0: p = 0.10, Ha: p < 0.10 using the large sample test for a population proportion.  To do so, she selects an SRS of 150 potatoes from the over 3000 potatoes on the truck.  Suppose that only six of the potatoes sampled are found to have major defects. The P-value of her test is: 
A:
 - less than 0.0002.
