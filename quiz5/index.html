<p>A statistician working for the National Basketball Association supplies the television announcers with interesting statistics.

  <p>In a large midwestern university (the class of entering freshmen being on the order of 6000 or more students), an SRS of 100 entering freshmen in 1993 found that 20 finished in the bottom third of their high school class.  Admission standards at the university were tightened in 1995.  In 1997 an SRS of 100 entering freshmen found that 10 finished in the bottom third of their high school class.  Let p1 and p2 be the proportion of all entering freshmen in 1993 and 1997, respectively, who graduated in the bottom third of their high school class. Is there evidence that the proportion of freshmen who graduated in the bottom third of their high school class in 1997 has been reduced, as a result of the tougher admission standards adopted in 1995, compared to the proportion in 1993?  To determine this, you test the hypotheses H0: p1 = p2, Ha: p1 &gt; p2. The P-value of your test is</p>

    <p>We do a pooled test here and hence the standard error is given by  \(\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n_{1}}+\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n_{2}}}\), where \(\hat{p} = (20 + 10)/(100 + 100)\). Plugging the correct values, we get \(se = 0.0505\) and hence \(z = 1.9803\). Using the normal distribution table, we can find \(p = 0.0238\) .</p>

    <p>Are the inflation rates of the United States and the United Kingdom associated? If so, can we  attempt to predict the U.S. Inflation Rate using the UK Inflation Rate?  Suppose we fit the   following simple linear regression model: U.S. Inflation Ratei = β0 + β1(UK Inflation Rate)i + εi, where the deviations εi were assumed to be independent and normally distributed, with mean 0 and standard deviation σ.  This model was fit to the data using the method of least squares.  A random sample of 20 annual rates was selected from the past 110 years’ rates. The following results were obtained from statistical software.</p>
