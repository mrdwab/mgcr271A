A statistician working for the National Basketball Association supplies the television announcers with interesting statistics.  At a certain point in the season, he discovered that of the 375 games where a team was winning the game at the end of the third quarter, 300 of those games were won by the team that was already winning.    The margin of error for a 90% confidence interval is: 
A) 0.040. 
*B) 0.340. 
C) 0.020. 
D) 0.026.

The newspaper took a random sample (assume it is an SRS) of 1200 registered voters and found that 640 would vote for the Democratic candidate.  Is this evidence that a clear majority of the population would vote for the Democratic candidate?  To answer this, test the hypotheses H0: p = 0.50, Ha: p > 0.50. The P-value of your test is: 
A) 0.4920. 
B) 0.0330. 
*C) 0.0104. 
D) less than 0.0002.

A recent book noted that only 22% of investment managers outperform the standard indexes, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the NASDAQ, over a five-year period. A sample of 400 investment managers that had graduated from one of the top ten business programs in the country were followed over a five-year period.  One hundred ten of these outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Let p represent the probability that a random investment manager who graduated from one of the top ten business programs will outperform the Dow Jones over a five-year period. 


Based on the results of the sample, a 95% confidence interval for p is: 
*A) (0.231, 0.319). 
B) (0.217, 0.333). 
C) (0.238, 0.312). 
D) We can assert that p = 0.22 with 100% confidence because only 22% of investment managers outperform the standard indexes. 

Suppose you wished to see if there is evidence that graduates of one of the top business programs perform better than other investment managers. To do this, you test the hypotheses H0: p = 0.22, Ha: p > 0.22. The P-value of your test is: 
A) 0.0080. 
*B) 0.0040. 
C) 0.0045. 
D) 0.0090. 

Suppose you wished to see if there is evidence that graduates of one of the top business programs perform better than other investment managers. To do this, you test the hypotheses H0: p = 0.22, Ha: p > 0.22. The decision made for this hypothesis test would be to: 
*A) reject H0 in favor of Ha.
B) not reject H0 in favor of Ha.
C) reject Ha in favor of H0. 
D) question your results because of the sample size of 400.

After the football team once again lost a game to the college’s arch rival, the alumni association conducted a survey to see if alumni were in favor of firing the coach.  An SRS of 100 alumni from the population of all living alumni was taken.  Sixty-four of the alumni in the sample were in favor of firing the coach.  Let p represent the proportion of all living alumni who favor firing the coach. A 95% confidence interval for p is: 
A) (0.583, 0.677). 
B) (0.552, 0.708). 
*C) (0.546, 0.734). 
D) (0.502, 0.758).

An inspector inspects large truckloads of potatoes to determine the proportion p in the shipment with major defects prior to using the potatoes to make potato chips.  Unless there is clear evidence that this proportion is less than 0.10, she will reject the shipment.  To reach a decision, she will test the hypotheses H0: p = 0.10, Ha: p < 0.10 using the large sample test for a population proportion.  To do so, she selects an SRS of 150 potatoes from the over 3000 potatoes on the truck.  Suppose that only six of the potatoes sampled are found to have major defects. Which of the following assumptions for inference about a proportion, using a hypothesis test, are violated? 
A) The data are an SRS from the population of interest. 
B) The population is at least 10 times as large as the sample. 
C) n is so large that both np0 and n(1 – p0) are 10 or more, where p0 is the proportion with major defects, if the null hypothesis is true. 
*D) There appear to be no violations.

A researcher is studying the failure rate of restaurants.  She selects a random sample of 200 restaurants in large cities that opened within the last year.  Following up on these restaurants, she finds that 80 had failed within five years. A 99% confidence interval for the proportion of restaurants that fail within five years is: 
A) 0.402 ± 0.035. 
B) 0.402± 0.044. 
C) 0.402 ± 0.057. 
*D) 0.402 ± 0.089. 


A researcher is studying the failure rate of restaurants.  She selects a random sample of 200 restaurants in large cities that opened within the last year.  Following up on these restaurants, she finds that 80 had failed within five years. To determine if opening a restaurant in a large city increases the chance of failure compared to opening a restaurant in a suburban or rural area we should: 
A) test the hypotheses H0: p = 0.50, Ha: p ≠ 0.50. 
B) test the hypotheses H0: p = 0.50, Ha: p > 0.50. 
C) test the hypotheses H0: p = 0.40, Ha: p > 0.40. 
*D) do none of these.

A) 1.3.

In a large midwestern university (the class of entering freshmen being on the order of 6000 or more students), an SRS of 100 entering freshmen in 1993 found that 20 finished in the bottom third of their high school class.  Admission standards at the university were tightened in 1995.  In 1997 an SRS of 100 entering freshmen found that 10 finished in the bottom third of their high school class.  Let p1 and p2 be the proportion of all entering freshmen in 1993 and 1997, respectively, who graduated in the bottom third of their high school class. A 90% confidence interval for p1 – p2 is: 
A) 0.098 ± .050. 
*B) 0.098 ± .083. 
C) 0.098 ± .099. 
D) 0.098 ± .130.

Let p1 and p2 be the proportion of all entering freshmen in 1993 and 1997, respectively, who graduated in the bottom third of their high school class. Is there evidence that the proportion of freshmen who graduated in the bottom third of their high school class in 1997 has been reduced, as a result of the tougher admission standards adopted in 1995, compared to the proportion in 1993?  To determine this, you test the hypotheses H0: p1 = p2, Ha: p1 > p2. The P-value of your test is: 
A) between .10 and .05. 
*B) between .05 and .01. 
C) between .01 and .001. 
D) below .001.
