  A newspaper conducted a statewide survey concerning the 2000 race for governor.  The newspaper took a random sample (assume it is an SRS) of 1200 registered voters and found that 640 would vote for the Democratic candidate.

  A recent book noted that only 22% of investment managers outperform the standard indexes, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the NASDAQ, over a five-year period.A sample of 400 investment managers that had graduated from one of the top ten business programs in the country were followed over a five-year period.  One hundred ten of these outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Let p represent the probability that a random investment manager who graduated from one of the top ten business programs will outperform the Dow Jones over a five-year period.

Q: >
  An inspector inspects large truckloads of potatoes to determine the proportion p in the shipment with major defects prior to using the potatoes to make potato chips.  Unless there is clear evidence that this proportion is less than 0.10, she will reject the shipment.  To reach a decision, she will test the hypotheses H0: p = 0.10, Ha: p < 0.10 using the large sample test for a population proportion.  To do so, she selects an SRS of 150 potatoes from the over 3000 potatoes on the truck.  Suppose that only six of the potatoes sampled are found to have major defects. Which of the following assumptions for inference about a proportion, using a hypothesis test, are violated? 
A:
  - The data are an SRS from the population of interest. 
  - The population is at least 10 times as large as the sample. 
  - n is so large that both np0 and n(1 – p0) are 10 or more, where p0 is the proportion with major defects, if the null hypothesis is true.

Q: >
 Are the inflation rates of the United States and the United Kingdom associated? If so, can we  attempt to predict the U.S. Inflation Rate using the UK Inflation Rate?  Suppose we fit the   following simple linear regression model: U.S. Inflation Ratei = β0 + β1(UK Inflation Rate)i + εi, where the deviations εi were assumed to be independent and normally distributed, with mean 0 and standard deviation σ.  This model was fit to the data using the method of least squares.  A random sample of 20 annual rates was selected from the past 110 years’ rates. The following results were obtained from statistical software.
