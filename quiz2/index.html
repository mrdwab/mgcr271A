<p>In order to determine if smoking causes cancer, researchers surveyed a large sample of adults.  For each adult, they recorded whether the person had smoked regularly at any period in their life and whether the person had cancer.  They then compared the proportion of cancer cases in those who had smoked regularly at some time in their life with the proportion of cases in those who had never smoked regularly at any point in their life.  The researchers found a higher proportion of cancer cases among those who had smoked regularly than among those who had never smoked regularly.  This is:</p>

<div class="quiz-multiple well" data-individual>
  <p>Recall that when we standardize the values of a variable, the standardized value has mean 0 and standard deviation 1.  Suppose we measure two variables, X and Y, on each of several subjects. We standardize both variables and then compute the least-squares regression line of Y on X for these standardized values.  Suppose the slope of this least-squares regression line is –0.44. Select ALL statements which are TRUE.</p>

<ol>
<li>the correlation will be 1.0.</li>
<li>the intercept will also be –0.44.</li>

    <p>The answer to this question relies on two important ideas. One, the regression line always passes through the point \((\bar{x}, \bar{y})\). Two, the slope of the regression line equals \(r \times s_y/s_x\). By standardizing \(X\) and \(Y\), we are now dealing with two variables whose means are zero and standard deviation is one. Hence, we have slope = \(-0.44 \times 1/1 = -0.44\), and intercept = 0 (line passes through (0, 0)). [Press p for more details]</p>

    <section>
      <p>If you would rather understand based on formulae, here is the solution. Let us represent the standardized values of \(X\) and \(Y\) using \(zX\) and \(zY\). We know that \(\mu_{zX} = \mu_{zY} = 0\) and \(\sigma_{zX} = \sigma_{zY} = 1\). Moreover, correlation between \(zX\) and \(zY\) is still -0.44, since it does not depend on the units. Using the formula for slope (\(b_1 = r \times s_y/s_x\)) and intercept (\(b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \times \bar{x}\))</p>

    <h2>Solution 4</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article>
    <p>Outliers influence the correlation coefficient, as they pull the line of best fit towards them. However, it is possible for outliers to both reduce, or amplify the correlation coefficient, based on the context. For example, consider the two scatterplots below. The line of best fit with the outlier is shown in blue and without the outlier is shown in red. </p>

<img src="fig/unnamed-chunk-12.png" width="45%" class="plot" /></div>

<p>Note that in the case on the left, having the outlier reduces the strength of the relationship, while in the case on the right, the outlier seems to create an implied linear relationship, when there is actually none.</p>

    <p>A statistics professor is interested in understanding the relationship between number of hours spent studying (Y) and the number of credits a student takes in a semester (X). After collecting data, he finds that both variables are normally distributed. The mean number of credits taken by students is 13.4 and the standard deviation is 2.2. The mean number of hours spent studying is 14.8 and the correlation between the two variables is 0.48. He conducts a linear regression of Y vs. X and finds that the slope equals one.</p>

<p>Hint. Jot down what is given, figure out what is missing, find the connection!</p>

    <p>We want to compute \(P(Y > 21.5)\). We know that \(Y\) is normally distributed with mean 14.8. If We knew the standard deviation, the probability is straight-forward to calculate. Now, we know that \(b_1 = r \times s_y/s_x\). We are given \(b_1 = 1\), \(r = 0.48\) and \(s_x = 2.2\). Plugging these values in, we get \(s_y = b_1 \times s_x/r\), which equals 4.5833.

  <p>For their 1992 study “The Effect of Country Music on Suicide” (published in Social Forces, vol. 71, p. 211), researchers Stack and Gundlach investigated various American communities, recording the number of minutes of daily radio airtime devoted to country songs and the suicide rate. They found a moderately strong positive correlation. In their paper, the researchers explain the results by saying that “…the themes found in country music foster a suicidal mood ...” (emphasis added).</p>

<!-- A news headline (The Independent [London], October 1, 2004, p. 15) about the research echoed these sentiments when it said, “Strange But True: Country Music Saps Will to Live.” The research is even cited on various suicide-prevention websites, some with headings such as “Country Music Increases Suicide Risk.” -->

<li>Yes, causality is indicated by the moderately strong correlation.<br></li>
<li>Yes, as long as the communities were sampled randomly, and the number of communities (the sample size) was sufficiently large.</li>
<li><em>No, because the lack of assignment of communities to different levels of country music listening means there is a possibility of lurking variables.</em></li>

    <p>This question differs from the previous one in that we are now interested in the possibility of only one of N or D happening, not both. Hence, we just subtract the probability of both happening from the probability of N or D happening. In other words, P(N or D but NOT both) is given by P(N or D) - P(N and D), which gives us \(0.55 - 0.15 = 0.40\) </p>

    <h2>Question 13 C</h2>

<p>The event experiencing NEITHER side effects is the <code>complement</code> of the event, experiencing either of the side effects. Hence the probability is just one minus the probability of experiencing either of the side effects, which gives us $1 - 0.55 = 0.45 $.</p>
